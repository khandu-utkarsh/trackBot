# TrackBot

**TrackBot** is a web application designed to help log gym workouts and food-related data using natural language input. It uses tool calling to parse user messages and store structured information seamlessly.

Once the basic logging functionality is in place, the goal is to implement intelligent querying capabilities. These will analyze all your logged data and provide personalized insights, suggestions, and responses.
